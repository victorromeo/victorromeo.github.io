DevOps is the software practice of iterative realization of product to target environments as the intersection of development, operations and quality assurance 

## Background

![Intersection](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Devops.svg/512px-Devops.svg.png)

Development, QA and Operation teams have a common vested interest in ensuring that applications are meeting their stated objectives in the most efficient manner.

### Development

- Development teams are tasked with application delivery.  
- Modern practices assume that development activities will be conducted as efficiently as possible.
- Developers therefore are expected to perform the minimum viable activities to produce the required product

### Quality Assurance

- Quality Assurance teams are tasked with ensuring applications are meeting the stated objectives of the product
- Failure in a public environment can be costly to a business in time, expense, reputation
- QA teams therefore attempt to ensure that applications meet the required objectives prior to the application failing in a production environment
- QA teams also assist the mitigation planning and resolution activities to resolve defects found either in production or other environments

### Operations

- Operations teams are tasked with ensuring that applications are available to the target audience 
- Operations teams are also tasked with the monitoring and lifecycle of applications and their underlying infrastructure
- As a result are best placed to detect aberrant application behaviour, user behaviours and the underlying data persistence and communication channels which support modern applications

## Pipeline 

![Pipeline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Devops-toolchain.svg/)

The pipeline acknowledges that applications and their dependencies:
- require planning
- change over time
- require testing to provide assurance
- are interdependent on what has come before (and to a lesser extent, what may come in the future)

### Plan 

Planning typical covers:
- Acquiring and understanding historical goals
- Preparing and defining future goals
- Application features, behaviours and maintenance of known issue lists
- Data, backups, and compression
- Reliability and accessibility of Communication channels
- Security of the application, its underlying data, the host infrastructure
- Delivery into the planned environments and removal of applications from old environments
- Requirements needed to sufficiently test an application, and model its behaviour in a production like environment
- Monitoring and logging of applications in flight and at rest
- Project hosting costs and changes to projected infrastructure needs

### Create

Create typically includes application development activity however may also include:
- Infrastructure commissioning
- Database maintenance
- Security modifications, including firewall patch design and transport level encryption changes
- Application load balancing changes

### Verify

Verification is required to ensure that activities undertaken in a Create phase, meet the stated objectives of those outlined in the Plan phase
- What has and has not changed
- Why have changes occurred
- Is the change correct and complete
- Is there a change to risk as a result of the change

### Package

Packaging is the act of collecting all planned and approved changes into an asset ready for release.

- Is the package ready to be deployed?
- Are all the package dependencies available, secure, reliable, licenced and vetted?
- Does the owner of the package understand the content of the package?
- Has authority been provided to proceed with a release?
- What mitigation plans will be undertaken to produce a rollback in the event of a failure?

### Release

Release implements the planned release of a package into and its associated dependencies, but also:
- Acknowledges change windows are adhered to by the operation team
- Communicates the actions taken during the change and records any activities which require further scrutiny
- Acknowledges when a release has either succeeded or failed 
- Implements mitigation where required to resolution of issues, using plans where possible

### Configure

Configuration after release ensures that the package is operating within the planned environment, with the planned changes to the infrastructure and other dependencies

- Make changes to network and application firewalls
- Make adjustments to load balancing and tuning of the resources required to make the application or package operate within planned tolerances
- Update application log monitoring to track new resources

### Monitor

Inspection of application behaviour may be monitored automatically or be implemented manually, however the end result is that:

- Authorised users are able to access the applications
- Devices hosting the applications and their dependencies are operating correctly
- Issues are identified early
- Communication is distributed quickly and covers the minimum detail required to address or further investigate issues
- Monitoring suitability is assessed and addressed promptly when gaps are detected
- Preparation for future planning activities is also prepared, based on all DevOp phases
